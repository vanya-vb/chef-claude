# 👨‍🍳 Chef Claude App

Chef Claude is a dynamic recipe web app developed during the **React State** module of the _React Basics_ curriculum on the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/home). Just input a list of ingredients and at the click of a button the list is being sent off to an AI API to generate a recipe.
